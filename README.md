This is trying to make some slides and publish to my Github page.

# What I did
I used [refreeze](https://github.com/bast/refreeze) here and I hope it's fine.

For very first time users, `git@github.com:you/example.git` didn't work for me.
This might be an old version thingy.
The new version is just how you add a remote with `https://github.com/you/example.git`

And the workflow could be
- 0. after all the things were set up and you passed the first time commit and push
- 1. keep `flask_app` running or start it by `python refreeze/flask_app.py`
- 2. modify your *talk.md* and refresh in your browser to see changes
- 3. after satisfaction, freeze it with `python refreeze/freeze.py`
- 4. push your modified *index.html* to Github
